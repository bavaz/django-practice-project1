# Sample Django Practice Project
Sample project based off https://medium.com/@arijbirnbaum/a-crash-course-in-django-f7a39629e7e0 with some tweaks.\
(A huge thanks to the author (Ari Birnbaum) for a well written tutorial)
This is something I tried out when I started learning Django.\
The steps.txt file contains quick notes I made while following the tutorial, including the steps I took.\
I've tried to make the steps clear with notations and comparisons to this repo's structure.\
Here's an image of the structure of files in my directory (I didn't include some folders):\
